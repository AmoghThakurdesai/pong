# Pong

This is a project that aims to milk the game Pong as much as possible for learning full stack web development.

The stack currently consists of 
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend 
- Flask for the backend with a SQLite3 Database used with Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM.

### TODO List
- Make the frontend better 
- Add history menu
- Add players
- Add user registration and login
- Add start menu
- Add multiplayer support from scratch??
- Make changes in main game ui that make the game more beautiful
- Make the players in canvas more rounded 
- Make everything in canvas more rounded
- Alter collision physics so that the reflection of ball depends on the position of ball relative to centre of player rect
- Make game divs flexible for various displays
- Refactor code at some point 

### TODO: p1id and p2id are hardcoded into the games played section, fix that
